Smart Battery Management System for renewable energy storage system using Reinforcement learning

This project successfully developed a Reinforcement Learning-based Smart Battery 
Management System. By leveraging Deep Q-Networks (DQN), the system learns to make 
intelligent charging and discharging decisions, optimizing battery lifespan and efficiency.
